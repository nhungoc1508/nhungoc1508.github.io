                        <p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, targeted cyberattacks designed to gain 
                            unauthorized access to systems and remain undetected for extended periods. To evade detection, 
                            APT cyberattacks deceive defense layers with breaches and exploits, thereby complicating exposure 
                            by traditional anomaly detection-based security methods. The challenge of detecting APTs with 
                            machine learning is compounded by the rarity of relevant datasets and the significant imbalance 
                            in the data, which makes the detection process highly burdensome. We present AE-APT, a deep 
                            learning-based tool for APT detection that features a family of AutoEncoder methods ranging from 
                            a basic one to a Transformer-based one. We evaluated our tool on a suite of provenance trace databases 
                            produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 
                            0.004% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and 
                            Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The outcomes showed that AE-APT has significantly higher 
                            detection rates compared to its competitors, indicating superior performance in detecting and ranking anomalies.

                        <p>A NY statewide model choice model is developed to deterministically fit heterogeneous coefficients 
                            for trips along each census block-group OD pair conducted by each population segment within a 
                            random-utility-consistent framework. The proposed approach is to use inverse optimization (IO) 
                            to derive coefficients for each OD pair times population segment as an agent. This is only possible 
                            with ubiquitous population data. We call this a group-level agent-based mixed logit (g-AMXL) model, 
                            which is an extension of the AMXL model proposed by Ren and Chow (2022). The significance of g-AMXL 
                            is as follows. First, g-AMXL takes OD level (instead of individual level) trip data as inputs, which 
                            is efficient in dealing with ubiquitous datasets containing millions of observations. Second, preference 
                            heterogeneities are based on non-parametric aggregation of coefficients per agent instead of having to 
                            assume a distributional fit. Third, since each agent‚Äôs representative utility function is fully specified, 
                            g-AMXL can be directly integrated into system design optimization models as constraints instead of dealing 
                            with simulation-based approaches required by mixed logit (MXL) models.

                            entities relevant in the context of COVID-19 and future epidemics. Using high-dimensional

        <p>I come from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province in Central Vietnam. I also spent three years in H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City during which
            I attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%AA_H%E1%BB%93ng_Phong_High_School_for_the_Gifted"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">L√™ H·ªìng Phong High School for the Gifted</a>. During my
            undergraduate years, I lived, studied, and conducted research in many cities around the world,
            including Abu Dhabi, New York, and London.</p>
        <p>I dabble in the arts and generally anything and everything that fascinates me. I enjoy playing the flute,
            taking amateur photographs (the featured photograph here was taken in Sweihan, Abu Dhabi), creating digital arts, 
            editing videos, and learning languages.</p>
        <p>Unless you speak fluent Vietnamese, it's highly likely that you won't be able to pronounce my name correctly.
            I'm giving you the blanket approval to pronounce it /knock/ :)</p>
